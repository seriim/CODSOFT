## About CodSoft
This internship provided an opportunity to tackle real-world tasks and showcase my skills. CodSoft is an innovative platform that enables developers to gain hands-on experience through practical projects.

## Installing Vue.js
To get started with Vue.js, follow the steps below to set up your local environment:

1. Install Node.js and npm
Before you can use Vue.js, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. These tools are essential for managing packages and running Vue.js projects.

- Download and Install Node.js:

   - Visit Node.js official website and download the latest stable version for your operating system.
   - The installation process will automatically install npm as well.
- Verify the Installation: After installation, open your terminal/command prompt and check the versions of Node.js and npm to ensure they are correctly installed:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   This will show the installed versions.

2. Install Vue CLI
The Vue CLI (Command Line Interface) is an essential tool for setting up and managing Vue.js projects. It helps you quickly scaffold new projects with a pre-configured setup and tools.

To install Vue CLI globally, use the following command:
```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
This installs Vue CLI globally on your system, allowing you to use it in any terminal session.

- Verify Installation: After installation, verify that Vue CLI has   been installed correctly by running:
``` bash

vue --version
```
3. Create a New Vue.js Project
Once you have Vue CLI installed, you can create a new Vue project using the following steps:

- Create a New Project: Navigate to the folder where you want to create your new Vue project and run the following command:
```bash
vue create my-vue-project
```
Replace my-vue-project with your desired project name.

- Choose Configuration: The Vue CLI will prompt you to select a preset configuration for your project. You can choose the default preset (which includes Babel and ESLint) or manually select features based on your needs. For a simple project, the default configuration works well.

- Navigate to the Project Folder: Once the project is created, navigate into your project directory:
```bash
cd my-vue-project
```
4. Run the Project Locally
To run your new Vue.js project locally:

- Install Dependencies: If you cloned an existing project (like the Quiz Creation Platform), you need to install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Start the Development Server: Now, you can start the Vue development server by running:
```bash
npm run serve
```
This will start the server and you‚Äôll see output indicating that the app is running at http://localhost:8080 (or another available port).

- Open in Browser: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to view the Vue app.
